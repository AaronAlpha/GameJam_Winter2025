W/S- nothing
Space - jump
Q - Silent Knight's Stab
E - Silent Knight's Slash
(sorry poor programming; slash and stab don't appear)
Silent Knight Health = 300
Silent Knight (you) DPS -> Stab = 10; Slash = 30 

Nutcracker Health = 300
Nutcracker -> Stab = 1 DPS; Slash = 5 DPS
(didn't know/have time to learn to implement enemy attack cooldown)
Therefore, you are at disadvantage because Godot's Game Engine's timer will deduct ur health faster

There are certain 'drops' around the level, these will especially benefit you. 

There is a final boss however he is programming-wise broken, but I would like for you to acknowledge my teammate's art
